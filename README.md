Projects while attending Codecademy courses

## Javascript projects
### 1.Meal Maker

  *Objective*:
  >"As a frequent diner, you love trying out new restaurants and experimenting with different foods. However, having to figure out what you want to order can be a time-consuming ordeal if the menu is big, and you want an easier way to be able to figure out what you are going to eat.
In this project, you’ll use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!"

### 2.Team Stats

  *Objective*:
  >"We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team. Basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. It’s your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays, objects, etc. Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them. For example, you might want to get the total number of games your team has played, or the average score of all of their games."

### 3.Mini Linter

  *Objective*:
  >"In this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph. This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned."

### 4.Lodash Library

  *Objective*:
  >"Try to replicate some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays." 
  >Here includes:
  >1. clamp(number,lower,upper)
  >2. inRange(number,start,end)
  >3. words(string)
  >4. pad(string,length)
  >5. has(object,key)
  >6. invert(object)
  >7. findKey(object,predicate)
  >8. drop(array,n)
  >9. dropWhile(array,predicate)
  >10. chunk(array,size)
