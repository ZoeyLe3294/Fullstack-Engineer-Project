Projects while attending Codecademy courses

## Javascript projects
### 1.Meal Maker

  *Objective*:
  >"As a frequent diner, you love trying out new restaurants and experimenting with different foods. However, having to figure out what you want to order can be a time-consuming ordeal if the menu is big, and you want an easier way to be able to figure out what you are going to eat.
In this project, you’ll use JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!"

### 2.Team Stats

  *Objective*:
  >"We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team. Basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. It’s your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays, objects, etc. Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them. For example, you might want to get the total number of games your team has played, or the average score of all of their games."

### 3.Mini Linter

  *Objective*:
  >"In this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph. This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Additionally, you may have heard of linting, a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, you will create a miniature version of a linter using array methods that you have learned."

### 4.Lodash Library

  *Objective*:
  >"Try to replicate some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays." 
  >Here includes:
  >1. clamp(number,lower,upper)
  >2. inRange(number,start,end)
  >3. words(string)
  >4. pad(string,length)
  >5. has(object,key)
  >6. invert(object)
  >7. findKey(object,predicate)
  >8. drop(array,n)
  >9. dropWhile(array,predicate)
  >10. chunk(array,size)
 
### 5.Credit Card Checker

  *Objective*:
  >"The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid." 
  >Validation Rules following [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)

### 6.Mysterious Organism

  *Objective*:
  >"You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study."
